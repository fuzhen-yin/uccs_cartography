## Welcome to Cartography Labs

This is the main website where you can find all lab related materials. This website is developed and maintained by [Dr. Fuzhen Yin](https://ges.uccs.edu/directory/faculty/fuzhen-yin-phd) from the department of [Geography & Environmental Studies](https://ges.uccs.edu/) at [UCCS](https://www.uccs.edu/).


## Acknowledgement

The tutorials included in this lab are structured based on the materials **Group Mini Project Digital Visualisation** developed by  [Dr. Duncan Smith](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/3886-duncan-smith/about) from [CASA UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa). Many thanks to [Dr. Duncan Smith](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/3886-duncan-smith/about). 


## Overview


This practical provides an introduction to Hypertext Markup Langauge (HTML), the foundation of web pages. It also introduces Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), the basis for the styling and layout of web pages, and the link between HTML and JavaScript libraries for interactive websites. 

Some tutorials for learning the basic of web design:

* [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - free education platform for learning code online 
* [LinkedIn HTML Online Training Courses](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/topics/html)


## What is a Web Page? HTML and CSS

At its most basic, the **web** is a series of files on a server that are downloaded and viewed in your web browser. The core files for a static web page are:

* **Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** files define the structure and content of web pages. HTML files directly contain the text content of the page on a static web page. Dynamic pages typically refer to external data files or database links on the server, that then generate HTML pages. HTML markup consists of tags containing content. The following is a paragraph element: 
  ``` <p>This is a paragraph on an HTML page</p>  ``` 
* **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** define the layout and presentation of a web page, including text styling, colors and position on the page. CSS information can be provided as part of an HTML file, or as an external file that is linked to from the HTML file header. 

## Publish Your Map GitHub

[Github](https://github.com/) is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.

Storing your code in a "repository" on GitHub allows you to:

- **Showcase** or share your work.
- **Track and manage changes** to your code over time.
- Let others **review** your code, and make suggestions to improve it.
- **Collaborate** on a shared project, without worrying that your changes will impact the work of your collaborators before you're ready to integrate them.

Our lab's website [Cartography Labs](https://fuzhen-yin.github.io/uccs_cartography/index.html) is hosted on GitHub and the source file can be found here: https://github.com/fuzhen-yin/uccs_cartography. 

- First, please go to [Github](https://github.com/) to create an account. 
- Then, you should see an interface similar to Figure 1.1. 

> A GitHub **repository**, or "repo," is a fundamental element of GitHub and Git, acting as a centralized storage for project files, allowing for version control and collaboration, and tracking changes and history. Let's create our first repository for the cartography class. 


- Click on your profile icon on the top-right


![Figure 1.1: Dashboard ](figs/github_1.png){width=100%}

<br>


- Next, go to **Your Repositories**. 

![Figure 1.2: Repositories ](figs/github_2.png){width=100%}

<br>


- Here you can see all your repositories and their status. Let's click on the green button  **New** to create a new Repository. 

![Figure 1.3: Repositories ](figs/github_3.png){width=100%}

<br>

- Configure the new repository by giving it a **name**. 
- Make it **Public** and **Add a README** file. 
- **Create repository**

> A **README** file in GitHub is a text file (often named README.md) that provides an introduction and documentation for a project hosted on GitHub, typically placed in the root directory of a repository, and is automatically displayed on the repository's main page


![Figure 1.4: Configure the repository ](figs/github_4.png){width=100%}

<br>

- The repository's homepage looks like the Figure 1.5 

![Figure 1.5: Repository Homepage ](figs/github_5.png){width=100%}

<br>

- Next, we are going to create **Pages** associated with this repository. 

> GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from a GitHub repository and publishes them as a website.


![Figure 1.6: Repository Settings ](figs/github_6.png){width=100%}

<br>

- Go to **Settings**, on the left panel, click **Pages** 
- Set the **Branch** to **Main** and **Save**

![Figure 1.7: Configure GitHub Pages ](figs/github_7.png){width=100%}

<br>


- Waiting for a few minutes, **refresh** by **clicking** on **Pages** again. You should see a line saying: 

> Your site is live at https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY/

- **COPY** this web address and save it somewhere as a text file (.txt), or **BOOKMARK** it. 

![Figure 1.8: GitHub Pages - Web address of your repository ](figs/github_8.png){width=100%}

<br>

- Okay, we will go back to the main page of your repository (see Figure 1.9) to upload some files.  
- Click **Add File** then **Upload files**

![Figure 1.9: Uploading files to the repository ](figs/github_10.png){width=100%}

<br>

- Upload your **.html** files and supporting files (e.g., stylesheet, images, data...)
- **Commit changes**

![Figure 1.10: Upload files & commit changes ](figs/github_11.png){width=100%}

<br>

- After uploading your files, go back to your repository home page, your repository should look like Figure 1.11
- To access **.html** file online, the url is **Web address of your repository (Figure 1.8)** + **/** + **HTML File Name**
- For example, mine is: https://fuzhen-yin.github.io/2025_carto_test/Mapbox_example11.html 
- Then, open this url in your browser, you should be able to your map online!!
